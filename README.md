# A-Better-Twitter
## Just a CSS style for Twitter that removes some bullshit from the website.

You can use it on Chrome by just draging the file in extensions screen or use the extension Stylus to install in your browser. You can send me suggestions or fixes as pull requests, if you do any I will put your name on the thanks list.

### Thanks to those who helped me fix and maintain the style:
